export const DESCRIPTION = [
  "Hello! I'm a computer science student at the University of Waterloo starting up my 3rd year. I am extremely obsessed with the whole tech movement how it shapes our world- anything from new product designs, gadgets, the internet of things -  and would love to contribute to the movement. I'd like to think that I'm both a dreamer and a doer - I have big dreams and would take small steps to quickly learn in order to achieve these visions.",

  "Recently, I'd say that I've become quite obsessed with coding, but in reality, I am just really driven from my curious nature due to fascination from everything around me, resulting in the desire to understand how everything works. Once I find myself engaged in a tough problem, I realize that time flies and before I know it, hours have passed by.",

  "Aside from coding, I spend countless hours on Youtube watching about everything (I usually have quite interesting phases). One moment it could be watching phone reviews, then it would be phone teardown videos, and then 3 months later, I'm watching baking videos (currently I'm binge watching guitar covers)",

  "I enjoy working on backend work, which is what I mainly focused on during my last two internships at Shopify and ADP. However, I also have a big passion for UI / UX design and visually creative projects. This branches over a variety of things, including front-end websites, aesthetically pleasing business reports, digital art, or video editing. I'd like to think I'm a creative bean- I always make sure that whatever I make, not only the content has to be solid, but the design should be appealing to the eye as well.",
